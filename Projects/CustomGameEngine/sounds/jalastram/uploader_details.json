  "about": "Jesús Lastra aka Voidborn Horde, is a Venezuelan ambient electronic music composer born in 1986. Since 2002, He starts this musical journey by exploring experimental sounds, influenced by ambient music and soundscapes that evoke vast and ethereal imaginary worlds. Under the alias Voidborn Horde, he has developed an unique style with electronic elements and ambient textures, finding a kind of \"false enviroment sounds\" to give the listener an immersive and dreamlike experience. His music is characterized by its ability to evoke neutral deep emotions and meditative states of patience, making him a reference in the ambient music scene.\n\n_________________________\n\nI'm just a software tester.
