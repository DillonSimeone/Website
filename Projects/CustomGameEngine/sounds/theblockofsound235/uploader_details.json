  "about": "Hello people. I am updating my profile a little bit. My real name is Jordan Gosselin, and I live in beautiful British Columbia Canada, and I am 29 years old. Here you will find never before heard sounds that I find on the internet and share here, as well as my own recorded sounds. I record ambiance sounds, crowds, ambulance and other emergency vehicle sirens, and more. I have a wide variety of sounds already on my profile, with more coming soon. So please feel free to follow me and download my sounds. I'm sure that I have something for you to use. Oh, and if you do use my sounds, please remember to include a link to my Freesound page so that others can find my sounds too. Thanks, and have a great day/night 😊😁\n\n~theblockofsound235.",
