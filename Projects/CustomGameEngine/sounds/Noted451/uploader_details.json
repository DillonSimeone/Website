  "about": "Studied audio production and sound design, but I'm more of a writer these days. Still, I love music, sounds, and recording sounds I find in the chaotic serendipity midst the perils of being in 3D. Sharing that chaos with others is always an added bonus!\n\nThanks for checking out my random sounds! If you have any questions, dm me anytime and I'll do my best to answer.",
