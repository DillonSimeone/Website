  "about": "Welcome to my collection of free sounds! Here you will find a wide range of audio for various creative projects: nature sounds, city sounds, Foley recordings, sound effects, and much more. My goal is to provide useful sound resources for musicians, filmmakers, game developers, and anyone in need of sound effects. All sounds are available for free use in your projects and are named according to the UCS (Universal Category System). Download, experiment, and create something unique! If you're looking for something special for your projects or have ideas for collaboration, feel free to reach out!\n\nCheck out my sound libraries:\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/KVV_Audio/packs/41033/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Landline Phone - VEF TA 68</a>\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/KVV_Audio/packs/43773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Music Sample - Kalimba</a>",
