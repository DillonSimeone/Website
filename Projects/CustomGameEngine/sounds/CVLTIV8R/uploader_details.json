  "about": "Cultivator of sound design, beats, fx, melodies, foley, field recordings, naturescapes, experimental tones, ambient environments, bassy things, as well as glitchy goodness, by both organic and inorganic processes.\n\nMy dream is to work with other creative people to create a range of soundtracks, videogames, multi-media art, voice-over productions, and/or sfx for the masses.\n\nAll samples here were created by myself. Feel free to use any of my sound designs for your creative works, credit is not mandatory though it is super appreciated.\n\nIf youd like to support my audiophile habits feel free buy me a coffee, my venmo is bradnon-mononoke\n\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/bradnon_art/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.instagram.com/bradnon_art/</a>\n\nSoundCloud: <a href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/bradnon\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.soundcloud.com/bradnon</a>",
