  "about": "Non-Avant-Gaurd sounds from the 22nd century, recorded in the garden of perversion. These sounds have been left under the sun for too long. They have been burnt to a crisp!\n\nFeel free to use these sounds for your projects, I always love seeing where these crispy sounds end up! No need to credit unless the sounds are used commercially.",
