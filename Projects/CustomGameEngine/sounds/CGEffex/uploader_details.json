  "about": "Well, not much to say about myself, but that I love recording and designing sounds and Freesound is a great place to share what I have worked hard on and get constructive feedback and critique.\r\n\r\n<strong>I can also provide custom sound design work for your project, depending on how busy I am. Please message me if you are interested and/or would like a quote</strong>\r\n\r\nMost of my samples here are licensed under the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons Attribution</a> license. As per the terms of this license, you must:\r\n<blockquote><strong><b>a)</b> Attribute my name: CGEffex\r\n<b>b)</b> Provide a notice of copyright and license (CC BY 3.0)\r\n<b>c)</b> Provide the title of the original work (for example: \"Cat_eating_peautbutter.wav\")</strong></blockquote>\r\nAn ideal attribution may take the form:\r\n<blockquote>This [video/theatre piece/work/...] uses these sounds from Freesound.org:\r\nsound1 by user1 (<a href=\"http://freesound.org/people/user1/)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://freesound.org/people/user1/)</a>\r\nsound2, sound3 by user2 (<a href=\"http://freesound.org/people/user2/)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://freesound.org/people/user2/)</a>\r\netc...</blockquote>\r\nAdditionally, I kindly ask that you:\r\n<blockquote><b>1.</b> Attribute Freesound.org directly in some way.\r\n<b>2.</b> Send me a message letting me know where/how you used my sample. I love hearing stories of people using my sounds all over the world!\r\n<b>3.</b> Upload some sounds yourself! More that half of Freesound users have less that 5 sounds. <em>Make a difference!</em>\n<b>4.</b> Tell your friends about the site and help it grow!</blockquote>\r\nNew tips and guidelines on my sounds:\r\n<blockquote><b>1.</b> Preview quality does not ideally reflect the quality of the downloaded file. If a sound does not sound just right, try downloading it before you make a final judgement\r\n<b>2.</b> When listening and/or working with my samples be sure you have a decent pair of speakers or headphones (I use a pair of Sony MDR-XD200 headphones).</blockquote>\n",
