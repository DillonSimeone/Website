  "about": "Hi there,\r\n\r\ni'm a <u>Beginner</u> in Sound-Design, but i am trying to learn and i <em>love</em> synthetic/synthesizer Sounds (like in Chiptunes and some Game-Soundtracks - mostly from the 8Bit and 16 Bit Era) and Orchestra Sounds (like in Movie- and some Game-Soundtracks).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, i am learning Sounddesign from a Course (Book) (as a hobby) and hope to add some very cool sounds in the future, created with my <em>Waldorf MicroQ Rack Virtual Analog Synthesizer</em> (the blue one).\r\n\r\n<strong>If you use my Sounds, <em>please let me know</em>; i really want to know, if you find my Sounds usefull :) .</strong>\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n.Ingo.\r\n\r\nPS: And sorry, if my Comments sound sometimes a bit strange - that is because english is my second language.",
