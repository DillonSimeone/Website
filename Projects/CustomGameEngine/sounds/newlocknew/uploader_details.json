  "about": "Hi! My name is Eugene! Sound and music have always been my passion. On the pages with my sounds you can find various sound effects, field recordings, a few soundtracks, musical excerpts and samples for music. As a rule, all sounds are carefully categorized according to the UCS system. Feel free to give your assessment by leaving comments. I really welcome it. Whenever possible, I am always happy to help, or answer questions (for example, about how some of my sounds were created), which can be asked via private messages.\nHOW TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE!!!\nAs for attribution, everything is simple. Indicate my data in the credits of your project. What to specify: my nickname (just like on the <a href=\"http://Freesound.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freesound.org</a> site), as the author, and the full names of the files (sounds) downloaded from the site and used in your project. Also, be sure to see additional information about how my sounds, effects and recordings can be used (in accordance with Creative Commons licenses) in the descriptions on the pages of these specific audio files.Thanks and good luck!",
