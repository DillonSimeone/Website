            <p>
                Alexis has many years of experience in the grooming industry and understands how easily cats can become stressed in unfamiliar and noisy environments. The fast-paced nature of a grooming salon can be overwhelming for some cats, making them even more anxious and stressed. During her time in the industry, Alexis noticed that products that didn't resolve issues or properly care for cats' skin and coats were being used on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                With her extensive experience in low-stress handling techniques, Alexis founded Shake It Off to provide a better alternative for your pet's health and your wallet. We offer personalized grooming services that take place in the comfort of your own home, where your pet can relax in a familiar environment. At Shake It Off, we prioritize your pet's well-being and use only high-quality products that are safe for your furry friend. You can trust that your cat will receive the care and attention they deserve without the added stress and risks of traditional grooming methods.

                Meet Alexis, the owner and groomer at Shake it Off Cat Groomz LLC. Alexis is Deaf, and has over 8 years of experience in the grooming industry. With her extensive experience and passion for animal care, Alexis is determined to provide a better grooming experience for your cat than what can be found at corporate grooming chains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alexis strongly feels a cat's well-being is of the utmost importance.  She believes that grooming should be a positive and stress-free experience for your cat, and will do everything she can to make sure your cat feels comfortable and safe during their grooming session.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to her commitment to your cat's well-being, she created Shake It Off Cat Groomz LLC  to offer a more convenient alternative to traditional salon grooming services.  Seeing first hand how the cats respond in the dog environment, the products put on them, the way they are handled by others, the way said "professionals" are taught to handle & service them, on top of all the unpredictable movements & sounds in the salon environment--- compelled Alexis to do something about it. So she did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, she found out that the cost could go over $400 for your cat to be sedated and groomed at a vet. While doing this is necessary at times, it can potentially put your cat's health at risk. In knowing that, she is taking steps to become certified through NCGI (national cat groomers institution) and become a CFMG (certified feline master groomer). Then she can work with more cats to help them avoid sedation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but not least, she thanks everypaw and human for supporting her passion to continue to provide the best service for our cats!
