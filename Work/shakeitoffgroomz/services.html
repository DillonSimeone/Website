                        grooming service is a good fit for you and your furry friend. The purpose of the home visit is
                        to
                        assess the suitability of your home for my grooming services and to ensure that your cat is

                    <p>
                        At Shake it Off Cat Groomz LLC, I understand that some kittens may be nervous or fearful during
                        the
                        grooming process. That's why I offer the Kitten Wash & Trim Exposure service, which is designed
                        to
                        gently ease your kitten into the grooming process and keep them comfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Kitten Wash & Trim Exposure service is suitable for kittens aged 9 weeks to 6 months and
                        includes a variety of grooming activities designed to introduce your kitten to the grooming
                        process.
                        These activities may include nail trimming, ear cleaning, brushing, bath and dryer exposure, and
                        clipper exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the safety and well-being of your kitten during the grooming process, I require that
                        all
                        kittens have received their rabies vaccine at four months of age or older. The goal of this
                        service
                        is to help your kitten become comfortable with the grooming process and to establish positive
                        associations with grooming activities. I am trained to work gently and patiently with
                        kittens, using techniques and tools that are safe and appropriate for their age and size.

                    <p>The Waterless Bath is a quick and convenient option that uses a specially formulated shampoo that
                        doesn't require water. We apply the shampoo to your pet's coat, work it in with a towel or
                        brush, and then remove excess shampoo with a towel or dryer. This service also includes a brush
                        out, ear cleaning, and nail trim.</p>
                    <p>
                        For an all-around grooming experience, try our Waterless Bath and Trim. This service includes
                        all the benefits of the Waterless Bath, with the addition of trimming your pet's fur, nails, and
                        paw pads. Additionally, you have the option to add on trimming of the ears, feet, and sanitary
                        area to further enhance your pet's appearance and hygiene.
                    </p>
                    <p>All our waterless services are customizable to meet your pet's specific needs, and are ideal for
                        pets who are anxious or fearful of water, have mobility issues, or for quick cleanups between
                        traditional grooming sessions. Whether you choose the Waterless Bath or the Waterless Bath and
                        Trim, you can rest assured that your pet will be left looking and feeling their best without the
                        need for water.</p>

                        between 1.5 mm to 1/2 inches, all over their body. This style is often referred to as a "lion

                        gives your cat a wild and regal appearance.

                        toes to keep them looking neat and tidy.

                    <p>
                        The Asian Lion Cut (Dino Clip) is a stylish and unique grooming style that involves shaving the
                        back
                        legs and lower back end area of your cat's body, while leaving the fur in the front and middle
                        section of the body intact. This style is ideal for cats with long or medium-length coats that
                        may
                        be prone to matting or tangles in the shaved areas. It can also help to eliminate most of the
                        problem areas that long-haired or older cats may have.

                        I offer a specialized bathing service for hairless cats. As these cats do not have a protective
                        coat of fur, it is important to keep their skin clean and moisturized to prevent dryness and
                        irritation.

                        specifically formulated for their sensitive skin. I also pay special attention to the areas
                        around
                        their ears, eyes, and nose, as these areas can be particularly delicate. This service also

                    <p>
                        After the bath, I carefully dry your hairless cat using a towel.

                    <p>
                        My bathing service for hairless cats is designed to keep their skin clean, healthy, and

                        further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to help.

                        During the bath, I take care to avoid getting water in your cat's ears and eyes, and I use a
                        moistening conditioner to help detangle their coat and make it easier to brush. I also pay
                        special
                        attention to the areas around their ears, eyes, and nose, as these areas can be particularly
                        delicate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My bathing service for short-haired cats is designed to keep their coat clean, healthy, and
                        well-groomed, while also providing a comfortable and stress-free experience. If you have any
                        further
                        questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to help.
                    </p>
