        <h2>What do I need to do to prepare for your visit</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure that you have a suitable enclosed space with hot and cold water access for grooming, such as a bathroom or utility room, and ensure that it is carpet-free. If you don't have a suitable space, please let me know in advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare a clean towel for drying and, if possible, a detachable shower head for easier washing. I have accommodations if there's no detachable shower head in the space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that your pet is easy to find and access. We recommend keeping them inside a kennel or in a
                    bathroom with the door closed during the grooming appointment. This will help prevent them from
                    running away or hiding during the grooming process. It will also make it easier for our groomers to
                    access your pet and perform the necessary grooming services.</li>
                </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What advice do you offer to all first appointments</h2>
        <blockquote>
            For all first appointments, I recommend the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that your pet is up to date on all necessary vaccinations. This is for the safety of your pet
                    and our groomers.</li>
                <li>If your pet has any medical conditions or allergies, please let us know in advance so that we can
                    take necessary precautions.</li>
                <li>Avoid feeding your pet a large meal immediately before their grooming appointment. A full stomach
                    may make them uncomfortable during the grooming process.</li>
                <li>Groom your pet regularly to help them become accustomed to the grooming process. This will make
                    their grooming appointments go more smoothly and will help reduce stress for both you and your pet.
                </li>
                <li>Be calm because cats are highly attuned to our emotions and can become anxious if they sense that we
                    are stressed or upset. Try to remain calm and relaxed during the grooming appointment to help your
                    pet feel more at ease. This will help make the grooming process go more smoothly and will help
                    reduce stress for both you and your pet.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Aftercare</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid getting your pet wet for at least 24 hours after grooming. This includes baths, swimming, and
                    playing in the rain.</li>
                <li>Brush your pet regularly to maintain their coat and prevent matting.</li>
                <li>Check your pet's paws regularly and trim their nails as needed.</li>
                <li>If your pet has any medical conditions or allergies, be sure to follow your veterinarian's instructions for aftercare.</li>
                <li>If you have any questions or concerns about your pet's aftercare, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am deaf, so please communicate through written messages or email. I am always happy to
                    help.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What happens if you can't groom my cat</h2>
        <blockquote>
            There may be times when I am unable to groom your cat due to health issues. For the safety and well-being
            of your pet, I will not proceed with grooming if we feel that it could potentially cause harm to your cat.

            There are a few reasons why I may not be able to groom your cat, including:

            <ul>
                <li>Medical conditions: If your cat has a medical condition that could be exacerbated by grooming, we
                    may need to defer grooming until the condition has been treated.</li>
                <li>Age: Very young or very old cats may not be suitable for grooming due to their delicate nature.</li>
                <li>Behavior: If your cat is aggressive or anxious, it may be unsafe to proceed with grooming.</li>
            </ul>

            If I am unable to groom your cat, I will discuss alternative options with you and offer recommendations
            for the best course of action. I am deaf, so please communicate through written messages or email.
            I am always happy to help and will do our best to ensure the safety and well-being of your pet.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Will you need help grooming my cat</h2>
        <blockquote>
            In most cases, I do not require assistance when grooming your cat. I am
            skilled in handling cats and will do my best to make the grooming experience as stress-free as possible
            for your pet.

            However, there may be some instances where I may ask for your assistance. For example, if your cat has a
            particularly thick coat and we need to shave certain areas, I may ask you to hold your cat while I shave.
            This is for the safety and comfort of your pet, as it allows us to groom them more effectively and reduces
            the risk of injury.

            If I do need your assistance, I will let you know in advance and will provide clear instructions on how
            you can help. I am deaf, so please communicate through written messages or email. I am always
            happy to answer any questions you may have and will do our best to ensure the safety and well-being of your
            pet.

        <h2>Do you groom elderly cats</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Yes, I do groom elderly cats. While the focus of our grooming service is always the comfort and well-being
            of your pet, we understand that elderly cats may have different needs and may require a different approach
            to grooming.

            For elderly cats, the focus of the grooming service will be on maintaining their overall health and
            well-being, rather than achieving perfect aesthetic outcomes. This may involve more gentle grooming
            techniques and a slower pace to ensure that your pet is comfortable and not stressed during the grooming
            process.

            If you have an elderly cat, I recommend discussing their specific needs and concerns with us in advance.
            I am deaf, so please communicate through written messages or email. I am always happy to answer
            any questions you may have and will do our best to accommodate your pet's needs and preferences.

        <h2>Do you groom kittens</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Yes, I do groom kittens. However, it is important to ensure that your kitten is old enough, healthy enough,
            and has received their rabies vaccine at four months of age or older to be groomed safely. I recommend
            waiting until your kitten is at least 9 weeks old and has received the required vaccines before booking
            their first grooming appointment.

            If your kitten has recently been spayed or neutered, I recommend waiting at least two weeks for males to
            recover and three weeks for females to recover before grooming. This will help ensure that your kitten is
            healthy and ready for grooming.

            If you have any questions or concerns about your kitten's readiness for grooming, please don't hesitate to
            reach out to me. I am deaf, so please communicate through written messages or email. I am always
            happy to answer any questions you may have and will do our best to ensure the safety and well-being of your
            pet.
