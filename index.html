                <div>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my corner of the web! With over a decade of experience in web development, I've honed
                        my craft to specialize in creating websites that are not only responsive but also accessible to
                        everyone. Despite my current role as a Lead Design Engineer, which keeps me busy overseeing
                        projects and pushing the boundaries of design, my passion for web development remains as strong
                        as ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey as a Deaf developer has given me a unique perspective, ensuring that inclusivity is
                        at the forefront of everything I create. Whether it's through face-to-face collaborations or
                        solo projects, I strive to foster environments where innovation thrives and user-centric design
                        is paramount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of the digital realm, you'll often find me embracing the great outdoors, diving into the
                        latest gaming trends, or delving into the precision of laser cutting. As a perpetual learner, I
                        thrive on challenges that push me to refine my skills, all while maintaining a steadfast
                        dedication to advancing accessibility and inclusion in technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am attending Portland Community College to complete a degree and earn a
                        certification in Creative Coding with a focus on embedded technology. Itâ€™s about time I get the
                        piece of paper that proves my abilities!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Join me on this journey where technology meets creativity, and together, let's build a more
                        inclusive digital landscape.

                <p>Safety is important when laser cutting! My laser cutter is in a corner in my lab, and I've found that
                    having a venting system that pulls all air away from my laser cutter massively improves the

                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must finger spell a word given by another player. The word
                        can
                        be anything from simple (like "cat") to complex (like "university"), depending on the skill

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Illustrations of common phrases like "Hello," "Thank you," "How are
                        you?"
                        etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must correctly sign the phrase that corresponds to the
                        image.
                        Other players verify the accuracy.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Action Signs</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Illustrations of actions like running, jumping, cooking, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Mime the action, have others guess, then sign a sentence using the
                        action.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Emotions</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Faces showing different emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised,
                        etc.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must sign the emotion depicted and then use it in a
                        sentence.
                        For example, if the emotion is "happy," they might sign "I am happy today."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Animal Signs</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Various animals like a dog, cat, bird, fish, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must sign the animal shown and use it in a sentence or a
                        short
                        story. For example, "The dog is playing in the yard."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Story Time</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> A scene from a story, such as a park, a school, or a kitchen.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must create a short story or sentence using signs to
                        describe
                        what's happening in the scene. Creativity is encouraged, and players can elaborate as much as
                        they
                        like.</p>

                    <p>3 Dices</p>

                        <p><strong>Player 1</strong> rolls the dices...</p>
                        <p><strong>Action Signs:</strong> Man falling</p>
                        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Coffee cafe with two ladies</p>
                        <p><strong>Emotion:</strong> Disgusted</p>
                        <p><strong>Player 1</strong> rearranges dices into scene - action - emotion</p>
                        <p>Signs about a pair of girls out front of a cafe. A plumper exits the cafe carrying a bucket
                            filled with slime... The plumper trips and falls over, splattering the girls with slime. The
                            girls are disgusted!</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>4 Dices</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Let there be chaos</p>
                    </blockquote>

                </blockquote>


                <h4>Short notes:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The fingerspelling side is like a wildcard, it can become anything affecting the entire story
                        when
                        more than one dice is rolled. It builds up signers' confidence in their fingershaping abilities.

                    Universal Music Project

                <p><a href="https://universalmusicdesign.org/">Universal Music Project</a></p>
                <p>Check out my latest project for Universal Music Design! I had the incredible opportunity to build
                    their website, and let me tell you, it's not your average music site. Using the <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a>, I
                    implemented FFT analysis on all audio sources within the website. What does that mean? Well, it
                    means I created a fog simulator that reacts to the frequency and volume of the music playing.</p>
                <p>Picture this: as the music plays, colorful fogs envelop the screen, each hue and intensity matching
                    the frequency and volume of the audio. It's like a visual symphony that lets the deaf experience
                    music in a whole new way. When you see purple fog, you know those high-pitched notes are hitting
                    just right. And when it's red, you can feel those deep bass tones rumbling through.</p>
                <p>This project isn't just about creating a cool visual experience, though. It's about breaking barriers
                    and making music accessible to everyone. As Confluence, one of the world's first recording studios
                    founded by a Deaf Music Producer, proudly declares on their website: "We take pride in pushing
                    boundaries, creating an environment where innovation thrives, and where sound is not just heard but
                    felt on a profound level."</p>
                <p>With this project, I aimed to embody that ethos, bridging the gap between sound and sensation, and
                    ensuring that music truly knows no bounds.</p>

                <p>
                    Alexis, the owner of shakeitoffcatgroomz, is a deaf entrepreneur who is passionate about bringing
                    joy
                    to pets and their owners through her services. As a fellow member of the deaf community, I was
                    honored to work with Alexis and help her bring her vision to life.</p>
                <p>
                    Alexis approached me with a clear vision of what she wanted for her online storefront at
                    <a href="https://go.moego.pet/">MoeGo</a>. She needed a simple yet stylish website that could be
                    quickly loaded and personalized to her liking. Working within her budget, I was able to leverage the
                    latest
                    technologies to create a website that not only met but exceeded her expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website has a clean and modern design, with a user-friendly interface that allows visitors to
                    navigate with ease. Alexis wanted the website to be visually appealing, and I made sure to
                    incorporate
                    high-quality images that showcase her products in the best possible light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the website is currently in its early stages, there is enormous potential for growth.
                    Alexis is
                    delighted with the website's current state, but we have discussed plans to expand it in the future.
                    As
                    her business grows, we will add more features and functionality to the website to keep it up-to-date
                    and
                    relevant to her customers.
                </p>
                <h3>Update:</h3>
                <p>
                    Regrettably, like many other startups, Alexis' business struggled to attract enough clients and
                    eventually had to cease its operations. It's always disheartening to witness such setbacks,
                    especially
                    for a passionate entrepreneur like Alexis, who had a remarkable vision. While her business journey
                    took
                    an unexpected turn, we can still appreciate the effort and dedication she put into it.
                    Entrepreneurship
                    often involves ups and downs, and there's no doubt that Alexis will carry the valuable lessons
                    learned
                    into her future endeavors.

                <p><a href="https://markvking.netlify.com/">Made a website for a client!</a></p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s a Gatsby front end, with a headless wordpress on the backend, and a Disqus comment systemâ€¦ Ah,
                    yes,
                    and a google sheet contact form! Hosted on Netlify! I put everything together with the goal of
                    keeping
                    the monthly costs close to free as possible, and ease of use for Mark.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why Gatsby?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Gatsby is a static site generator. The static sites it outputs is unmatched in speeds, due to
                    everything
                    being compressed down much as possible, far beyond whatâ€™s normally done with a hand-crafted website
                    from
                    ten years ago! This makes it so the website downloads and displays on peopleâ€™s devices faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the many ways Gatsby achieves its speed is to pull in all of the contents itâ€™ll be using from
                    all
                    over the place via GraphQL when itâ€™s generating a static website, and merge all of the files that
                    makes
                    up the website into a single file with a minimum amount of white spaces in it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A normal hand-made website from before Gatsbyâ€™s time would have a lot of files that needs to be
                    downloaded one at a timeâ€¦ Styles, pages, pictures, javascript, etc. When peopleâ€™s devices are
                    downloading files, there is a bit of lag between files, which can easily add up to seconds before
                    the
                    website is finally completely loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s faster to download a single file than many files, even if the single file is bigger than all of
                    the
                    other files put together!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And oh boy, thereâ€™s the pluginsâ€¦ Long story short, thereâ€™s a bunch of black magic going on out of
                    sight
                    deep within Gatsbyâ€™s guts. Goat sacrifices, cultist chanting, elder gods stirring in their slumbers,
                    etc. Iâ€™m still not quite sure whatâ€™s going on, but I like it! Iâ€™ll be using Gatsby more often down
                    the
                    road.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why WordPress?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    WordPress have a smartphone app for posting posts from, and is much easier to pull data from than
                    twitter or facebook. I figured that this would be the best option for Mark. Install the smartphone
                    app
                    on his phone, and have his nurses to make posts, with pictures, videos or whatever! Poke the app,
                    make
                    post, text away, post and done!
                </p>
                <p>
                    WordPress have a bunch of drawbacks if youâ€™re also using it as the front end for your websiteâ€¦ Slow
                    load
                    speeds, due to each visitors needing to download many, many files before the website displays.
                    Thereâ€™s a
                    lot of moving parts on the server side too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    WordPress also doesnâ€™t allow you to have custom styles unless you sign up for a monthly plan, among
                    other numerous limits.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Chopping the head off (Headless CMS!) solves a lot of those issues. Each time the Gatsby front end
                    is
                    rebuilt, it pulls all posts from WordPress. The power of the WordPress, and the speed of Gatsby,
                    folded
                    into a single entity!
                </p>
                <h3>Why Disqus?</h3>
                <p>
                    Somehow linking up comments between wordpress and the gatsby front end was an option, but it turned
                    out
                    to be much easier to just throw a Disqus comment widget into the blog page, and have different
                    threads
                    to be loaded for each selected posts.
                </p>
                <p>Disqus is also designed just for commentsâ€¦ So they have more support for comments. In WordPressâ€™s
                    case,
                    itâ€™s like being a jack of all trades, master of none. Using Disqusâ€™s comment system instead of
                    WordPressâ€™s comment system also makes it much easier to display comments in real time rather than
                    requiring the website to be destroyed and rebuilt each time someone posted a new comment. </p>
                <h3>Google Sheets? Are you crazy!?</h3>
                <p>A bit! My initial plan was to just use Netlifyâ€™s form system to handle the contact form, but it
                    turned
                    out that there was a limit to the number of forms the system would accept for a free account! 100
                    submission a month!</p>
                <p>This work-around I implemented adds a lot of flexibility in that area. As it is now, messages sent
                    though
                    the contact form gets passed to a google script web app that appends the google sheet with the name,
                    email and message then email Markâ€™s Gmail with the information, along with a link to the google
                    sheet so
                    he wonâ€™t miss a single thing! Cool thing about this, in the gmail window, heâ€™ll be able to just
                    click on
                    the email address to start writing an email to them right away! That wouldnâ€™t had been possible with
                    Netlifyâ€™s system!</p>
                <h3>Why Netlify?</h3>
                <p>Netlify is one of the two options out there (Heroku is the other). I went with Netlify because for
                    months, Iâ€™ve heard nothing but praise from my nerdy friends about how easy Netlify makes everything.
                </p>
                <p>Iâ€™m blown away! Netlify is a match made in heaven for Gatsby, because of the webhooks Netlify
                    provides.
                    Attach those hooks to something, and when that something changes, the hookâ€™ll get tugged on which
                    trigger an actionâ€¦ In this case, a rebuild of the gatsby website! Soon as a new wordpress post is
                    made,
                    WordPress tugs on the webhook I dragged over from Netlify into wordpressâ€™s guts to trigger a rebuild
                    of
                    the Gastby front end! </p>
                <h3>Total Montly Costs?</h3>
                <p>And in the end, I've managed to keep the monthly cost at zero for this set-up!</p>
                <p>The sweetest thing is, if any part suddenly goes up into flames. Like, google dissolving somehow,
                    easy as
                    pie for me or any other nerds that have a vague understanding of what's going on here to pop out the
                    burning parts and plug in a different part! Take the comment system, for example, there's like ten
                    other
                    options out there! (And even more ways to craft one out of nothing... Like using google sheets!)</p>
                <p>Wordpress goes down into flames? Find a new content management service and chop off the head then
                    attach
                    Gatsby over the bloody stump!</p>
                <p>Nettlify goes nuclear? Heroku!</p>
                <p>Everything but Gatsby melts down somehow? Self-hosting!</p>

                        I became very interested in ThreeJS when I discovered that the library had support for VR gears.
                        I thought, why not make a personal world instead of a personal website, like in those weird
                        japan animes? This "Hello World" experiment with ThreeJs showed me that the learning curve with
                        this library is very gentle. It's easy to do anything with ThreeJS, just read the documentions!
                        It's very well documented, and there's PLENTY examples to reverse-engineer for whatever you
                        need!

                        On a whim, I decided to try to find a way to arrange texts into a circle.
                        I thought it would be easy... It wasn't easy at all! Some trigonometry was
                        required to arrange everything into circle. The result of this miniproject
                        is that I now have a very easily reuseable snippet of code that can arrange
                        anything into circles... If I wanted to, I could make it recursive, circles all
                        the way down and up!

                    <p>
                        I heard that by cheesing how HTML and CSS works, you can make onclick-like
                        events to occur without using any scripting languages. This miniproject is

                    <p>
                        The checkbox hack is a VERY interesting approach to accessibility. It's bad
                        semantics, but it's very dobable to design websites that fake onclick events
                        by using the checkbox hacks. The main drawback is that it will not degrace
                        gracefully when used in older browsers... Instead of degrading in any ways,
                        it would just break, completely!

                    <p>
                        This project was an exercise in dynamic programming. The goal was to make something that
                        would change based on the choices the user makes. I went way overboard by deciding to
                        turn
                        an .ebook into easily parseable JSON for a javaScript engine I made to work with text
                        adventure books! It will work with any text adventure book long as the input is the
                        JSONified book.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the book I selected, it was pretty fun finally "playing" the book after porting it
                        over. I didn't read a single thing in the book when figuring out how to easily jsonifity
                        it. If I had to redo the project, there is a ton of things I would be able to do better.
                        Sadly, an adventure book parser/player thingy isn't THAT cool!</p>

                    <h2>Moving Popup</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was inspired by a random attack by randsomwares and annoying pop-ups on a
                        website to see how annoying I could make those pop-ups to be! What I came up
                        with is a pop-up that, soon as it's spawned, start running around the screen
                        making it very frustrating to try to close the pop-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One big thing I learned from this miniproject was that pop-ups can only be
                        triggered by the client's actions, limited to a single pop-up per action, so
                        you can't for example, cause thousands of pop-ups to appear on a single click.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found a few ways to completely lock up the browser in a way where the task
                        manager is needed to kill the browser... Because that vector of attack is so
                        annoying, I'm not posting it here! The one I'm making public is harmless, you
                        can stop the pop-up window from moving by closing the website page that spawned
                        the pop-up.

                        it in both PHP and JavaScript. With PHP, it was much easier to
                        extract infomation about visters, and it was easy to set the script
                        to email me asking me to update it when it encounters a new type of
                        browser and devices.

                        Design a custom website that uses Steam's APIs to make a better search engine. Steam's GUIs are
                        very basic, and lacks a lot of functions... Due to that, it can be hard to find new and
                        interesting games that you haven't already seen. I've dug up a few too much overlooked gems to
                        not consider attempting to design something better.

            </h1>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                My hobbies are hiking, gaming both on flat screens and in virtual reality, building minihouses with
                various materials, and reading. There's nothing like hiking up
                to a waterfall, then pulling out a new sci-fic book at the shores and setting in for the day!
            </p>
            <p>
                Words about me getting along with people nicely due to the language barrier making it much easier for
                cooler heads to previl. Honeyed words, with sugar poured on.
            </p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I was exposed to programming for the first time in middle school when I joined the robot club. In high
                school, I partook in the FIRST Robotics Competitions.
                C++ was the first language I learned, I've gone on to learn many others since then. After the first
                couple of languages, the rest just clicks together.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current farvorite language is Javascript. A decade or so ago, Javascript was a pretty poor language,
                requiring the like of the JQuery library to become useable.
                Nowdays, JavaScript have grown into a pretty ridiculous language. Webassembly, promises, and fetch are
                the three biggest feature that stood out to me over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Straight out of high school, I went to Oregon State University... To become a chemical engineer. I did
                great with inorganic chemistry, but when organic chemistry
                came into play, it forced me to carefully rethink my college plans. After that, I started wandering from
                degrees to degrees before somehow finally landing onto
                website design at Rochester institute of technology. All went well up until my last year, where
                cooperative education was required be completed before the
                capstone courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, family issues forced me out of college. It was supposed to be a temporary break in my
                college jounrey, but half a decade flew by in a blink.
                My grandparents are now dead, and my dad will soon be dead. I'm free to resume living now with no
                worries about anything else getting into the way.
