                <h2>A multifaceted innovator driving accessibility in technology.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Welcome! I’m a maker, developer, and designer with over a decade of experience turning ideas
                        into working things; websites, devices, installations, you name it. I’ve built everything from
                        responsive, accessible sites to custom hardware for live performances. These days I’m a Lead
                        Design Engineer, but I still take on freelance work of all shapes and sizes: 3D printing parts,
                        prototyping gadgets, creating interactive art, or helping bring “wouldn’t it be cool if…”
                        concepts to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Deaf developer, inclusivity is built into everything I create. I’ve found that the most
                        interesting projects often come from unexpected collaborations—engineers, artists, educators, or
                        just curious people with wild ideas. If you’ve got something unconventional in mind, I’m all
                        ears (metaphorically speaking).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work, you’ll usually find me outdoors, gaming, or in the workshop tinkering with
                        laser-cut designs. I’m constantly chasing new skills and challenges, with a steady focus on
                        making technology more accessible and engaging for everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m currently finishing my degree in Creative Coding at Portland Community College, specializing
                        in embedded tech. It’s about time I got the official piece of paper to go with the skills I’ve
                        been building for years!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If it can be built, I’ll find a way to make it happen! Let’s talk, whether it’s an accessibility
                        tool, a custom gadget, or an art piece that needs a little engineering magic.

                <p>
                    Like many nerds, I've picked up a bunch of high-tech hobbies such as laser cutting and 3D
                    printing! I'm good at a lot of things, but taking pictures isn't one of them.
                </p>

                    screaming until the neighbors call the police, but some are pretty neat!

                <p>The rules are as follows:</p>
                <h4>FingerSpelling</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Hand shapes for each letter of the alphabet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must finger spell a word given by another player. The word
                        can
                        be anything from simple (like "cat") to complex (like "university"), depending on the skill
                        level.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Everyday Phrases</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Illustrations of common phrases like "Hello," "Thank you," "How are
                        you?"
                        etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must correctly sign the phrase that corresponds to the
                        image.
                        Other players verify the accuracy.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Action Signs</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Illustrations of actions like running, jumping, cooking, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Mime the action, have others guess, then sign a sentence using the
                        action.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Emotions</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Faces showing different emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised,
                        etc.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must sign the emotion depicted and then use it in a
                        sentence.
                        For example, if the emotion is "happy," they might sign "I am happy today."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Animal Signs</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> Various animals like a dog, cat, bird, fish, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must sign the animal shown and use it in a sentence or a
                        short
                        story. For example, "The dog is playing in the yard."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Story Time</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Picture:</strong> A scene from a story, such as a park, a school, or a kitchen.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The player must create a short story or sentence using signs to
                        describe
                        what's happening in the scene. Creativity is encouraged, and players can elaborate as much as
                        they
                        like.</p>

                    <p>3 Dice</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>Player 1</strong> rolls the dice...</p>
                        <p><strong>Action Signs:</strong> Man falling</p>
                        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Coffee cafe with two ladies</p>
                        <p><strong>Emotion:</strong> Disgusted</p>
                        <p><strong>Player 1</strong> rearranges dice into scene - action - emotion</p>
                        <p>Signs about a pair of girls out front of a cafe. A plumber exits the cafe carrying a bucket
                            filled with slime... The plumber trips and falls over, splattering the girls with slime. The
                            girls are disgusted!</p>

                    <p>4 Dices</p>

                </blockquote>


                <h4>Short notes:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The fingerspelling side is like a wildcard, it can become anything affecting the entire story
                        when
                        more than one dice is rolled. It builds up signers' confidence in their fingershaping abilities.

                <p>
                    Todd Fadel launched a contest for PatchXR, with winners judged on best use of AR, AI, or physics, plus a “kindest overall” category. 
                    PatchXR is an important tool for the Deaf community, providing accessible, modern music-making environments and a quick way to collaborate remotely. 
                    I designed and built custom award pieces for the winners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each award was based on the PatchXR logo, with the “XR” portion mounted to a motor that spins when it detects a loud enough sound. 
                    I integrated <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5509">n00ds</a> (flexible LED filaments) on the motor to mimic PatchXR’s in-app glowing signal wires. 
                    Under the “Patch” letters, I installed addressable LED strips programmed to map brightness to loudness level and color to frequency. 
                    This mirrors the signal-mapping concept that’s core to PatchXR’s design.

                    OMSI reached out to CymaSpace about its <a href="https://omsi.edu/events/oregon-sci-fest/">Oregon
                    Science Festival</a>, then CymaSpace reached out to me. I was given a specific budget, so I did
                    my best to make a kit that fits the budget. A lot of corners was cut, but I managed to pull together
                    something pretty neat!
                </p>

                    The <a href="https://microbit.org/new-microbit/">Micro Bit V2s</a> are pre-flashed with <a href="https://microblocks.fun/">Microblocks</a>, 
                    which makes reprogramming it possible and easy with any devices capable of running chrome, including smartphones! I was able to secure a bulk 
                    deal to get 30 kits within the budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controllers have sensors and outputs built right into it, ready to be played with out of the box
                    without any soldering or assembly required. The other parts in the box are extras, confirmed to
                    work. The OLED screen is an unique addon because the Micro Bit V1s did not have the capacity to run
                    OLED screens. If all goes well, CymaSpace will be stocking those kit boxes at the Woodstock Cafe
                    year-round and eventually have me to design add-on kits for the core kit, each with their own
                    themes, lights, motors, sensing, etc.

                <h2>LED Controller Workshop</h2>
                <p>
                    I ran a workshop at CymaSpace’s Woodstock Cafe where participants built and programmed their own LED
                    controllers using <a href="https://microblocks.fun/">MicroBlocks</a> flashed onto
                    <a href="https://www.espboards.dev/esp32/esp32-c3-super-mini/">ESP32 SuperMinis</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fun part? These specific ESP32 boards can be bought in bulk for under two dollars each.
                    MicroBlocks makes them accessible to complete beginners while still being powerful enough for
                    serious projects. Unlike Arduino C++, there’s no IDE to install, any device that can run Chrome can
                    also program a MicroBlocks-compatible board, either by USB or over Bluetooth if the hardware
                    supports it. That includes smartphones and tablets! (Horrible experience, but still...!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also 3D-printed the shells for the LED strips and demonstrated just how much physical abuse LED
                    strips can take before failing, and how to repair them when they do. Nearly every part of the kits
                    was 3D-printed, except for the LEDs and controllers.

                <p>
                    I helped design and build GeLu for Universal Music Design at CymaSpace. It is a pair of wearables for
                    gesture input, fingertip haptics, and audio-reactive light so Deaf folks can perform and feel music. We
                    premiered it at NIME 2024. <a href="https://nime.org/proc/nime2024_15/">Read the research paper</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    GeLu v2 was the final version created under UMD. From GeLu v3 onward, all design and development have been conducted independently by me using my own resources.

                    talking about the GeLu and my future plans for GeLu. I'll eventually be taking this to crowdsupply!
                    Many other engineers was impressed by how seamlessly the GeLu improved their awareness of the room.
                    It was awesome talking to Andrew! He indirectly made many things in my life easier, especially
                    related to open-sourced hardwares!

                </a>
                <p>
                    Portland Community College invited me to visit their advanced Interface Design class (MUC 262) on
                    March 3 2025. I haven’t taken any of PCC’s wearable tech courses by then, but they still called my
                    session a masterclass, which felt like a huge compliment!
                </p>
                <p>I brought in GeLu and a few other prototypes to show how I approach rapid prototyping for
                    accessibility, especially using haptics to make music and sound more tangible. We spent the session
                    testing different feedback patterns, talking through build decisions, and exploring how interface
                    design changes when you focus on feel instead of just sight or sound.

                </a>
                <p>
                    Think petting zoo, but instead of goats and chickens, it’s a bunch of hacked-together machines that
                    poke, buzz, rumble, and squish in strange ways. I set up a room full of different haptic devices so
                    people could walk around and touch sound — bass thumps you can feel in your chest, fingertip buzzers
                    that tickle like carbonated water, and low-frequency shakers that make tables feel alive. The goal
                    was to explore how many ways we can send information through skin and bones instead of ears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watching people bounce between devices, compare sensations, and then try to “play” them like
                    instruments was the best part. I left with a pile of new ideas for haptic patterns, some hardware to
                    rebuild, and a strong reminder that curiosity scales way better than volume knobs.

                </a>
                <p>
                    One of the works I did with Universal Music Design was building their website, but not just a
                    regular music site.
                    I wired it up with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web
                        Audio API</a> so it could run live FFT analysis on any audio playing. The result? A reactive fog
                    simulator that changes color and intensity based on the frequency and volume of the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High notes bring a purple haze. Deep bass rolls in with red. The sidebar becomes a visual
                    translation of the music, letting Deaf and Hard of Hearing users experience sound in a more tangible
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, it’s not just about visuals. It’s about making music more accessible. Confluence, one of the
                    first
                    recording studios founded by a Deaf music producer, sums it up perfectly:
                    “We take pride in pushing boundaries, creating an environment where innovation thrives, and where
                    sound is not
                    just heard but felt.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s exactly what I aimed for with this build: turning audio into a shared sensory experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alexis, the owner of shakeitoffcatgroomz, is a deaf entrepreneur who is passionate about bringing
                    joy
                    to pets and their owners through her services. As a fellow member of the deaf community, I was
                    honored to work with Alexis and help her bring her vision to life.</p>
                <p>
                    Alexis approached me with a clear vision of what she wanted for her online storefront at
                    <a href="https://go.moego.pet/">MoeGo</a>. She needed a simple yet stylish website that could be
                    quickly loaded and personalized to her liking. Working within her budget, I was able to leverage the
                    latest
                    technologies to create a website that not only met but exceeded her expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website has a clean and modern design, with a user-friendly interface that allows visitors to
                    navigate with ease. Alexis wanted the website to be visually appealing, and I made sure to
                    incorporate
                    high-quality images that showcase her products in the best possible light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the website is currently in its early stages, there is enormous potential for growth.
                    Alexis is
                    delighted with the website's current state, but we have discussed plans to expand it in the future.
                    As
                    her business grows, we will add more features and functionality to the website to keep it up-to-date
                    and
                    relevant to her customers.
                </p>
                <h3>Update:</h3>
                <p>
                    Regrettably, like many other startups, Alexis' business struggled to attract enough clients and
                    eventually had to cease its operations. It's always disheartening to witness such setbacks,
                    especially
                    for a passionate entrepreneur like Alexis, who had a remarkable vision. While her business journey
                    took
                    an unexpected turn, we can still appreciate the effort and dedication she put into it.
                    Entrepreneurship
                    often involves ups and downs, and there's no doubt that Alexis will carry the valuable lessons
                    learned
                    into her future endeavors.

                <p>
                    It’s a Gatsby front end, with a headless wordpress on the backend, and a Disqus comment system… Ah,
                    yes,
                    and a google sheet contact form! Hosted on Netlify! I put everything together with the goal of
                    keeping
                    the monthly costs close to free as possible, and ease of use for Mark.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why Gatsby?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Gatsby is a static site generator. The static sites it outputs is unmatched in speeds, due to
                    everything
                    being compressed down much as possible, far beyond what’s normally done with a hand-crafted website
                    from
                    ten years ago! This makes it so the website downloads and displays on people’s devices faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the many ways Gatsby achieves its speed is to pull in all of the contents it’ll be using from
                    all
                    over the place via GraphQL when it’s generating a static website, and merge all of the files that
                    makes
                    up the website into a single file with a minimum amount of white spaces in it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A normal hand-made website from before Gatsby’s time would have a lot of files that needs to be
                    downloaded one at a time… Styles, pages, pictures, javascript, etc. When people’s devices are
                    downloading files, there is a bit of lag between files, which can easily add up to seconds before
                    the
                    website is finally completely loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s faster to download a single file than many files, even if the single file is bigger than all of
                    the
                    other files put together!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And oh boy, there’s the plugins… Long story short, there’s a bunch of black magic going on out of
                    sight
                    deep within Gatsby’s guts. Goat sacrifices, cultist chanting, elder gods stirring in their slumbers,
                    etc. I’m still not quite sure what’s going on, but I like it! I’ll be using Gatsby more often down
                    the
                    road.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why WordPress?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    WordPress have a smartphone app for posting posts from, and is much easier to pull data from than
                    twitter or facebook. I figured that this would be the best option for Mark. Install the smartphone
                    app
                    on his phone, and have his nurses to make posts, with pictures, videos or whatever! Poke the app,
                    make
                    post, text away, post and done!
                </p>
                <p>
                    WordPress have a bunch of drawbacks if you’re also using it as the front end for your website… Slow
                    load
                    speeds, due to each visitors needing to download many, many files before the website displays.
                    There’s a
                    lot of moving parts on the server side too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    WordPress also doesn’t allow you to have custom styles unless you sign up for a monthly plan, among
                    other numerous limits.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Chopping the head off (Headless CMS!) solves a lot of those issues. Each time the Gatsby front end
                    is
                    rebuilt, it pulls all posts from WordPress. The power of the WordPress, and the speed of Gatsby,
                    folded
                    into a single entity!
                </p>
                <h3>Why Disqus?</h3>
                <p>
                    Somehow linking up comments between wordpress and the gatsby front end was an option, but it turned
                    out
                    to be much easier to just throw a Disqus comment widget into the blog page, and have different
                    threads
                    to be loaded for each selected posts.
                </p>
                <p>Disqus is also designed just for comments… So they have more support for comments. In WordPress’s
                    case,
                    it’s like being a jack of all trades, master of none. Using Disqus’s comment system instead of
                    WordPress’s comment system also makes it much easier to display comments in real time rather than
                    requiring the website to be destroyed and rebuilt each time someone posted a new comment. </p>
                <h3>Google Sheets? Are you crazy!?</h3>
                <p>A bit! My initial plan was to just use Netlify’s form system to handle the contact form, but it
                    turned
                    out that there was a limit to the number of forms the system would accept for a free account! 100
                    submission a month!</p>
                <p>This work-around I implemented adds a lot of flexibility in that area. As it is now, messages sent
                    though
                    the contact form gets passed to a google script web app that appends the google sheet with the name,
                    email and message then email Mark’s Gmail with the information, along with a link to the google
                    sheet so
                    he won’t miss a single thing! Cool thing about this, in the gmail window, he’ll be able to just
                    click on
                    the email address to start writing an email to them right away! That wouldn’t had been possible with
                    Netlify’s system!</p>
                <h3>Why Netlify?</h3>
                <p>Netlify is one of the two options out there (Heroku is the other). I went with Netlify because for
                    months, I’ve heard nothing but praise from my nerdy friends about how easy Netlify makes everything.
                </p>
                <p>I’m blown away! Netlify is a match made in heaven for Gatsby, because of the webhooks Netlify
                    provides.
                    Attach those hooks to something, and when that something changes, the hook’ll get tugged on which
                    trigger an action… In this case, a rebuild of the gatsby website! Soon as a new wordpress post is
                    made,
                    WordPress tugs on the webhook I dragged over from Netlify into wordpress’s guts to trigger a rebuild
                    of
                    the Gastby front end! </p>
                <h3>Total Montly Costs?</h3>
                <p>And in the end, I've managed to keep the monthly cost at zero for this set-up!</p>
                <p>The sweetest thing is, if any part suddenly goes up into flames. Like, google dissolving somehow,
                    easy as
                    pie for me or any other nerds that have a vague understanding of what's going on here to pop out the
                    burning parts and plug in a different part! Take the comment system, for example, there's like ten
                    other
                    options out there! (And even more ways to craft one out of nothing... Like using google sheets!)</p>
                <p>Wordpress goes down into flames? Find a new content management service and chop off the head then
                    attach
                    Gatsby over the bloody stump!</p>
                <p>Nettlify goes nuclear? Heroku!</p>
                <p>Everything but Gatsby melts down somehow? Self-hosting!</p>

                        I became very interested in ThreeJS when I discovered that the library had support for VR gears.
                        I thought, why not make a personal world instead of a personal website, like in those weird
                        japan animes? This "Hello World" experiment with ThreeJs showed me that the learning curve with
                        this library is very gentle. It's easy to do anything with ThreeJS, just read the documentions!
                        It's very well documented, and there's PLENTY examples to reverse-engineer for whatever you
                        need!

                        On a whim, I decided to try to find a way to arrange texts into a circle.
                        I thought it would be easy... It wasn't easy at all! Some trigonometry was
                        required to arrange everything into circle. The result of this miniproject
                        is that I now have a very easily reuseable snippet of code that can arrange
                        anything into circles... If I wanted to, I could make it recursive, circles all
                        the way down and up!

                    <p>
                        I heard that by cheesing how HTML and CSS works, you can make onclick-like
                        events to occur without using any scripting languages. This miniproject is

                    <p>
                        The checkbox hack is a VERY interesting approach to accessibility. It's bad
                        semantics, but it's very dobable to design websites that fake onclick events
                        by using the checkbox hacks. The main drawback is that it will not degrace
                        gracefully when used in older browsers... Instead of degrading in any ways,
                        it would just break, completely!

                    <p>
                        This project was an exercise in dynamic programming. The goal was to make something that
                        would change based on the choices the user makes. I went way overboard by deciding to
                        turn
                        an .ebook into easily parseable JSON for a javaScript engine I made to work with text
                        adventure books! It will work with any text adventure book long as the input is the
                        JSONified book.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the book I selected, it was pretty fun finally "playing" the book after porting it
                        over. I didn't read a single thing in the book when figuring out how to easily jsonifity
                        it. If I had to redo the project, there is a ton of things I would be able to do better.
                        Sadly, an adventure book parser/player thingy isn't THAT cool!</p>

                    <h2>Moving Popup</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was inspired by a random ransomware attack and annoying website pop-ups to see
                        how irritating I could make them. I came up with a pop-up that starts running
                        around the screen as soon as it spawns, making it very frustrating to close.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One big thing I learned from this mini project is that pop-ups can only be
                        triggered by user actions and are limited to one pop-up per action, so you can't,
                        for example, make thousands appear from a single click.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found a few ways to completely lock up the browser so that the task manager is
                        needed to kill it. Because that vector of attack is so annoying, I'm not posting
                        it here! The version I'm sharing is harmless—you can stop the moving pop-up by
                        closing the page that spawned it.

                        easier, and I set the script to email me whenever it encountered a new browser or device.

                        interfaces are very basic and lack many functions, making it hard to discover new and
                        interesting games you haven't already seen. I've uncovered too many overlooked gems not to
                        consider creating something better.
